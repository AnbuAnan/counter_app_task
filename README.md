* Support for multiple users.

* A reusable custom gradient button with a loading indicator.

# Tech Stack

* Flutter

* Dart

* SharedPreferences for local data storage

# Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate how authentication and session handling can be implemented locally in Flutter. It also serves as a simple reference for using SharedPreferences as a local database and structuring Flutter code for small projects.
